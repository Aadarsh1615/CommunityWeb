# Members Management Feature

## Overview
The AdminHub now includes a comprehensive members management system that allows admins and users to add, edit, and remove members from the community. All member data is stored in a MySQL database for persistence.

## Database Structure

### Members Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE members (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    role ENUM('admin', 'member', 'moderator') DEFAULT 'member',
    status ENUM('active', 'inactive') DEFAULT 'active',
    added_by INT,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    FOREIGN KEY (added_by) REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE SET NULL
);
```

## Features

### 1. View All Members
- Displays all active members in a clean, organized list
- Shows member name, email, role, and avatar with initials
- Real-time member count display
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop

### 2. Add New Members
- Modal form for adding new members
- Required fields: Name, Email, Role
- Email validation and duplicate checking
- Automatic role assignment (admin, member, moderator)

### 3. Edit Members
- Modal form for editing existing members
- Pre-populated with current member data
- Validation for all fields
- Real-time updates

### 4. Delete Members
- Individual member deletion with confirmation
- Bulk deletion of selected members
- Soft delete (sets status to 'inactive')
- Confirmation dialogs for safety

### 5. Search and Filter
- Search functionality (ready for implementation)
- Role-based filtering
- Checkbox selection for bulk operations

2. **Members Not Loading:**
   - Verify the members table exists
   - Check browser console for JavaScript errors

3. **Add/Edit Not Working:**
   - Check browser console for API errors
   - Verify all required fields are filled
   - Ensure email format is valid

### Testing:
Use `test_members.php` to verify database connectivity and table structure.
